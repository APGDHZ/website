Nanoelectronics: Vision and Reality
==================================
Scaling down the channel length of metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) has been an extremely successful path to increase the performance of integrated circuits (ICs): A larger number of transistors fits onto the same chip area while the transistors themselves exhibit an improved performance. However, scaling the channel length to ever smaller dimensions may lead to dramatically increased leakage currents that result in an unacceptably high power consumption of integrated circuits. Introducing novel materials and in particular three-dimensional transistor architectures as well as reducing the supply voltage of ICs, the semiconductor industry has been able to keep the power consumption at an acceptable level. However, the operational principle of MOSFETs leads to a fundamental limit that does not allow for a further, substantial reduction of the supply voltage (and hence power consumption) with the existing technology. Therefore, novel device concepts that rely on e.g. quantum mechanical tunneling as switching mechanism are currently investigated intensively. 
In the tutorial talk, an overview of the operational principles of MOSFETs will be given and the relevant measures to keep the scaling pace up (i.e. 3D architectures such as nanowire wrap-gate FETs, novel materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, carbon nanotubes etc.) will be presented. Finally, band-to-band tunneling FETs will be introduced and discussed as an alternative device concept for future ultralow power ICs.
