Nanoporous Materials - Synthesis and Application
=============================================
Ordered, nanoporous materials possess unique properties that make them interesting for a large variety of applications, including as gas sensors, electrode materials, or magnetic devices. Their synthesis is typically accomplished by utilization of porogenic supramolecular entities or by the so-called nanocasting method. In the latter approach the pores of a solid structure matrix (e.g. silica) are filled with a precursor compound for the desired product (e.g. sucrose for porous carbon or metal nitrates for metal oxides), which is then converted in-situ, followed by selective removal of the matrix. As a result, mesoporous materials with uniform pores (few nanometers) and large surface-to-volume ratios (few hundred m2/g) are obtained. The tutorial lecture will introduce the general methods of synthesis and standard characterization techniques. In addition, the presentation will cover some examples, such as porous carbon materials as sorbents or electrodes in battery devices, porous metal oxides as gas/humidity sensors, and magnetic materials with interesting nanostructure-related properties.
