EnFI School
In addition to the EnFI concept of previous years, we will offer Student Courses on Sunday afternoon of July 5th at the EnFI venue followed by a small beer-garden gathering.   

The courses reflect local expertise and thus focus on interfacing neural tissue and suitable materials:  
•	Electrochemistry and Design Considerations of Electrodes by Prof. Dr. Hannes Maier  
•	Stimulation, Recording and Signal Analysis at several Functional Levels of Neural Tissue by Prof. Simone  

If you are interested to participate, please check this box and add your name (preregistration).  
With registration, you will be asked to confirm your preregistration. Please note, that we probably will ask you for an additional fee of 20€ for the EnFI summer school.
