title: EnFI School


In addition to the EnFI concept of previous years, we will offer Student Courses on Sunday afternoon of July 5th at the EnFI venue followed by a small beer-garden gathering.   

The courses reflect local expertise and thus focus on interfacing neural tissue and suitable materials:

•	**Electrochemistry and Design Considerations of Electrodes** by Prof. Dr. Hannes Maier  
•	**Stimulation, Recording and Signal Analysis at several Functional Levels of Neural Tissue** by Prof. Dr. Simone Kurt
