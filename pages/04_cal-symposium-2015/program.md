The Symposium will begin with an informal get-together on October 26th in the late afternoon at 6 p.m. You are asked to register on-site between 5 and 6 p.m. 
The scientific program will start on October 27th at 8:30 a.m. and end on October 28th at 3:00 p.m.

The program will consist of:

- plenary lectures summarizing the state of the art in certain topics
- expert talks giving a more specific insight into selected research areas
- a workshop to discuss and define the roadmap 

A detailed program with all scheduled sessions and invited speakers is listed below.
