The scientific program will start on October 27th at 8:30 a.m. and end on October 28th at 3:00 p.m.

The program will consist of:

  - plenary lectures summarizing the state of the art in a certain topic
  - expert talks giving a more specific insight into selected research areas
  - a workshop to discuss and define the roadmap 

A detailled program with all scheduled sessions and invited speakers is listed below.
