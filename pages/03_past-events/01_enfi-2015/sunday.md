title: EnFI School


In addition to the EnFI concept of previous years, we will offer the EnFI School on Sunday afternoon of July 5th at the EnFI venue followed by a small beer-garden gathering.   

The courses reflect local expertise and thus focus on interfacing neural tissue and suitable materials.

Please note: 
The speakers for the tutorials have changed, leading to a 1h Tutorial each.
