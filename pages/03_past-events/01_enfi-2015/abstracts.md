title: Abstract submission
status: hidden

**Submission deadline changed to April 28th.**

All contributions to the EnFI conference are double contributions:

1. A brief, oral presentation of **maximum** 3 minutes with not more than four to five PowerPoint slides. Presentation language is english.
These brief presentations serve as appetizers for starting in-depth discussions during the poster sessions. Please bring your presentation on a memory stick: we will collect all presentations on a ‘presentation computer’ during the breaks and before the beginning of each session.

2. A poster presentation following immediately after each of the four topical sessions. All posters can be stalled on the presentation day and adhesive material will be provided. The recommended poster format is A0 in upright orientation. Other formats are possible but the width must not exceed 118 cm.

The three best contributions will be honoured with a Best Paper Award. The winners will be identified by an independent jury, taking into account the quality of the oral- and the poster presentation including a scientific discussion. Postdoctoral researchers and former laureates are not eligible for winning the Best Paper Award.

For presenting at EnFI-2015 it is compulsory to hand in the abstract in the standard layout along the email address: **enfi-2015(at)mh-hannover.de** with the subject **[Abstract]Lastname,Firstname**. Please embed the figures in a printer friendly quality (about 300 dpi) in the document, but avoid abstracts files bigger than 2 MB.
