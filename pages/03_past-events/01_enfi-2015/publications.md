Special issue 'Engineering of Functional Interfaces' in physica status olidi (pss)    

Related to this year’s workshop and in continuation of a long-standing tradition of the EnFI series it is planned to publish a regular special issue (no conference proceedings) with selected contributions on engineering of functional interfaces, as a reference to latest developments in the field, in pss (a) – applications and materials science. In collaboration between the Guest Editors and the pss Editorial Office we cordially invite you to contribute a Feature Article (topical review) or Original Paper manuscript based on your presentation. Further Contributed Articles may appear in pss (c) – current topics in solid state physics.

The physica status solidi journals are designed to reach a broad audience in the field of condensed matter and materials physics. pss is one of the largest and well-established publication platforms in solid state physics with more than 1500 articles per year – now over 50 years in business – and is widely accessible as part of many institutional site licenses, evidenced by close to one million article downloads annually.

All submitted manuscripts will undergo peer review. According to the editorial policy of pss, two positive recommendations by independent referees are a prerequisite of acceptance. Peer review and publication occur rapidly on individual manuscript basis. Published in Wiley Online Library Early View few weeks after acceptance, your article is citable immediately; hence there is no waiting for the remainder of the contributions. When all articles are complete, the topical section will be assembled in a regular monthly issue of pss (a). The clustering of related articles raises the visibility of these articles significantly, and once again we are confident that this will become a quality publication reflected by high article access and citation numbers.
