title: Scheper Lab - Pharmacology of the Inner Ear


The research group Pharmacology of the Inner Ear examines strategies to deliver drugs to the auditory system in order to improve the performance of the cochlear implant by protecting the auditory neurons and residual sensory cells as well as reducing fibrous tissue reactions. We are identifying relevant drug targets, kinetics and pharmacotherapies in addition to development and testing of suitable drug delivery systems.
