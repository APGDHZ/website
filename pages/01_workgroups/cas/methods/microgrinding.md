## manual Microgrinding
Method for Imaging of histological/morphological samples:

- embedded of the samples in epoxy
- grinding in slices of 100µm (manual process)
- post-processing for registration and stitching of an high resolution detail image
- export of the generated 3D dataset in DICOM format
