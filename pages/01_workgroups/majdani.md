## Research

The focus of our research activities is directed at the use of computer-assisted surgery (CAS) based on high-resolution imaging technologies, in order to improve the precision and safety of surgical procedures, particularly on the lateral skull base. These include the use of intraoperative navigation techniques, mechatronic assistance systems and methods of computer-aided simulation and pre-operative planning. Building on this, the continued goal is to develop adaptive cochlear implant (CI) electrodes and to integrate these into the overall concept of a minimally traumatic approach to the cochlea that preserves residual hearing.

Because of the complex anatomy of the lateral skull base and the substantial social relevance of hearing, cochlear implantation represents one of the core applications for this technology. As part of the German Research Foundation’s (DFG) focus programme on ‘Medical Navigation and Robotics’ (SPP 1124), experimental set-ups were created using a navigation-assisted manual approach and a robot-assisted drilling approach to create a minimally invasive canal from the surface of the skull to the cochlea. This allows the cochlear implantation to be performed without the large surgical approach involving a mastoidectomy that is necessary when conventional surgical techniques are used. In response to the specific requirements arising from the need to insert the CI electrode array through the new minimally invasive approach, an automated insertion tool was developed in cooperation with the Institute of Mechatronic Systems (IMES) at the Leibniz University of Hannover, which facilitated the controlled insertion of the electrode into the inner ear.

Promising concepts can then be characterized in insertion studies on cochlear models or temporal bone specimens. The expertise of the research group includes insertion studies both with force measurement and under fluoroscopy, aimed at drawing correlations between the insertion forces arising and the deforming properties of the implant *in situ*.

### The major focuses of this research group are

-   Use of medical imaging, particularly the importance of flat panel detector technology in visualization using volume tomography

-   Imaging of cochlear implants, including limitations of MRI imaging

-   Use of a surgical navigation system for guiding a surgical drill tool to avoid injuring at-risk structures

-   Robot-assisted, minimally invasive access to the cochlea for cochlear implantation

-   Image-guided, microsterotactic approach to the cochlear for cochlear implantation

-   Development and evaluation of an insertion tool for introducing the CI electrode into the cochlea through the minimally invasive approach

-   Development of active CI electrodes for atraumatic insertion in surgical techniques designed to preserve residual hearing

-   Finite-Element-Analysis of CI-electrodes and their mechanical interaction with the inner ear

-   Accurate imaging modality and 3D-modelling of the middle and inner ear using histological serial cross-section imaging (so called microgrinding)
