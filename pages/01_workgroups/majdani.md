## Research

The group "Computer-Assisted Surgery and Electrode Development" (CAS-hno) is an interdisciplinary research group of engineers, physicians, and natural scientist at the Department of Otolaryngology whose common focus is on the development of technologies and methods for surgical rehabilitation of the inner ear (cochlear). 

This includes research activities dedicated to the design and development of surgical assistance devices in order to improvement surgical techniques - with special focus on the minimally invasive approach to the inner ear. Based on high-resolution imaging and pre-operative patient-specific planning different technologies of image-guides surgery systems, mechatronic assistance devices as well als micro-stereotactic frames are incoorporated into the surgical workflow for an highly accurate and less traumatic surgical intervention. 

The second  research focus is on the improvement of the electrode array of a cochlear implant (CI) including the insertion technique. In this field, our research group covers the complete design and development process. Starting with imaging and three-dimensional (3D) modelling of the human inner ear, the methods used include: development of improved electrode designs using compputer aided design (CAD) software and finite element analysis (FEA); the simulation and optimization of the insertion process; experimental characterization of the electroe arrays by manual and/or automated insertion in artificial cochlear models and/or temporal bone specimens. Of special interest is the functionalization of the electrode array by integrating of actuators (e.g. by us of shape memory materials, fluid mechanical actuators, and tubular manipulators) for an individual adaption of the shape of the implant to the helical shaped inner ear in order to improve hearing preservation.
