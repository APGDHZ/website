Our research group focuses on the investigation of the active process in the mammalian inner ear and the functional replacement of the pathophysiologically damaged inner ear through novel mechanisms of stimulation such as optoacoustics and newly developed microconverters. 

Optoacoustic stimulation in the cochlea describes the stimulation due to irradiation with laser light which could lead to a higher frequency resolution compared with electrical cochlear implants, promising an improved hearing performance for patients suffering from sensorineural hearing loss. To investigate these effects we are using various laser systems as well as different methods, for example the patch clamp technique and laser doppler vibrometry and cooperate with several international partners in the EU project [ACTION](http://www.action-project.eu). 

Furthermore we study the effects of electrode-nerve interactions, drug releasing cochlear implant coatings and the consequences of microstructured implant surfaces on the interaction with cell populations in order to improve future implants. Employed methods include cell culture, histology, multielectrode array measurements and confocal laser scanning microscopy.
