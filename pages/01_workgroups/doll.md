<!--Bild zur Forschung-->

The research group BioMaterial Engineering works towards development and production techniques for new electrode concepts for active implants.
Our material concepts cover nanocomposites as biocompatible, low impedance CNT-silicone rubber electrodes , microelectronic circuits for implantable on-board electronics as well as encapsulation strategies to chronic application of them. Also sillicone rubber 3D printing is developed for medical device applications. We develop biochemical sensors for acute in-vivo use as well actuators that make implants hugging to their target tissue.
 
The work group has dual appointment to Fraunhofer. In its Institute for Toxicology and Experimental Medicine ITEM (LINK) we perform addditional biocompatibility testing, risk- and quality management and devlop advanced testing methods suitable for implant developments that go beyond clinical standards.
