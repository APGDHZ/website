##[NeuEar](http://www.neuear.eu) ![Logo NeuEar](neuearklein.jpg)
The NeuEar concept is to develop an encapsulated cell (EC) therapy device capable of long-term intracochlear neurotrophin
production in combination with a cochlear stimulating electrode implant to improve the clinical benefits by rescuing 
primary auditory neurons from degeneration and promoting the neuron-electrode interface. In addition, the project will
pave the way for a stand-alone neurotrophic implant as a potential regenerative therapy to the inner ear without the use 
of an electrode. 

##[Prohearing](http://www.prohearing.eu) ![Logo Prohearing](Prohearklein.jpg)
This SMALL/MEDIUM ENTREPRISE (SME)-driven program is based on the scientific rationale that free radical formation and blood
flow reduction underlie cell death affecting sensory systems in response to environmental stress and with aging. 
The stress caused in the auditory system, lead to excess free radical formation, blood flow reduction, inner ear sensory cell loss, and irreversible hearing impairment.
Our aim UNDER PROHEARING is to demonstrate that a proprietary combination of antioxidants (vitamine A, C and E) and a 
vasodilator (Mg) will effectively treat and eventually prevent loss of residual hearing patients receiving cochlear implants.

##Development of an implant-linked alginate matrix for cell-mediated neuronal protection  
The aim of this project is to develop a cell-mediated neuroprotection based on an alginate matrix. The cochlear implant electrode which is functionalized with a cell-alginate coating is used as model system.
