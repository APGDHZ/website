* DFG-project "Development of an implant-linked alginate matrix for cell-mediated neuronal protection"    


##Development of an implant-linked alginate matrix for cell-mediated neuronal protection  
The aim of this project is to develop a cell-mediated neuroprotection based on an alginate matrix. The cochlear implant electrode which is functionalized with a cell-alginate coating is used as model system.
