* DFG-project "Development of an implant-linked alginate matrix for cell-mediated neuronal protection"    


##[NeuEar](http://www.neuear.eu) ![Logo NeuEar](Neuear.jpg)
The NeuEar concept is to develop an encapsulated cell (EC) therapy device capable of long-term intracochlear neurotrophin
production in combination with a cochlear stimulating electrode implant to improve the clinical benefits by rescuing 
primary auditory neurons from degeneration and promoting the neuron-electrode interface. In addition, the project will
pave the way for a stand-alone neurotrophic implant as a potential regenerative therapy to the inner ear without the use 
of an electrode.
