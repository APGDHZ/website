## About
The **IHeaR** project, developed by a team of Prof. Prof. Thomas Lenarz and Prof. Dr. Theodor Doll, combines the hearing research of the cluster of excellence [**Hearing4All (H4A)**](http://hearing4all.eu/EN/) in Hannover, with the also internationally recognized group the [**Auditory and Cognition Center (AUCO)**](http://www.auco.cl/) in Chile and Argentina. This collaboration is sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Based on the modell of the  hearing center in Hannover, the german-chilean corporation aims to provide basic research, as well as to continually improve patient care. The basis of the project is initially the scientific exchange between the project partners in hearing, medical engineering research and brain-computer interfaces (BMI) for cognitive science. The IHeaR project want to advance the international hearing research by exchanging knowledge and working together. A particular concern is to improve and accelerate research results into medical care and ultimately to patients.  

## Conferences
In order to ensure a bilateral exchange program for young researchers and doctors, three young doctors from Chile have already been received at **[Hannover Medical School (MHH)](https://www.mh-hannover.de/) in Hannover**. Following the successful workshop on **March 2018** (see figure below), the project partners are looking forward to the next meeting.

After the Otorrinolaringología [(ORL 2018)](http://www.orl2018.cl/) congress another round in meetings will be held on **November 2018 in Santa Cruz**, followed by a three-day conference with interesting workshops on **April 2019 in Buenos Aires**. Following this, on **November 2019** the kick-off of the consolidation phase will be implented to manifestate prepared political decision at ministerial level. In **2020**, doctors and hearing researchers will be invited to **Santiago** for the two-day dissemination meeting. Subsequently, scientists and experts from South America will be invited to **Hannover** for the **2020** Symposium "Workshop Medicine and Engineering in Hearing Restoration". Thereafter,  a Scientific Meeting will take place in **Buenos Aires in 2021**. And finally, in **2022** the last Scientific meeting will be held in **Santiago** and a wrap up Meeting in **Buenos Aires** will complete the IHeaR project.
