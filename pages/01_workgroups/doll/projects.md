##Research Grants

* Lower Austria Life Science Grants LS010-017
* Cluster of Excellence Hearing4All

##Conferences
* We have recently hostet the Conference **[Engineering of Functional Interfaces](03_enfi-2015.html)**
* We are currently organizing the International Symposium **„Closing the Auditory Loop“** (26.10.-28.10.2015) funded by the VW-Stiftung.   
The main goal of the Symposium is the creation of a roadmap that defines challenges, critical experiments and milestones on a pre-competitive basis. It will also help to initiate new research collaborations as well as joint funding programs. To achieve this challenging goal selected, international leading experts of the various contributing fields (anatomy, signal processing, modelling, surgery, system integration, technology etc.) are invited. Besides academia also representatives from specialized industry will be invited to participate. Further, we are planning to invite young researchers to give new and inspiring input.



##Ongoing Projects
* **Feedback loop and fluid flow electrode - FLOWTRODE** (BMBF: KMU Innovativ Medizintechnik)  
	Please contact [Prof. Doll](staff.html) for more information.

* **Flexible Individualized Active Medical Implants – 3D Printing of Silicone Rubber Connectors and Electrodes - FINAMI** (BMWi: ZIM KF-VP)   
	Please contact [Prof. Doll](staff.html) for more information.

* **Multizentren-Produktionslogistik und Qualitätssicherung für Neurotechnologie** (Innovationsförderprogramm Forschung und Entwicklung, N-Bank) Adapted, highly flexible ECoG electrode systems are developed, leading to a prototype that can be testet by the end-user. By implementing an innovative multicenter product development and suitable product logistics a resource saving process is possible.

* **Flexible, selfbending multielectrode shafts** ([Hearing4All](http://hearing4all.eu/EN/))   
We explore the hypothesis that for CI better ambient noise understanding can be achieved by a higher number of electrode contacts – if the CIs clinge well to the modiolus. A side aspect of such R&D must be that the stiffness of CIs must not exceed the present state in order to avoid increased insertion tissue damage and trauma in general. Thus the wiring techniques of today must be altered. We test Au on parylene / polyimide films and CNTs immersed in silicone rubber. Parallelly we explore Hydrogel bimorph swelling elements for proper clinging actuation. The Start project lays the basis to further procurement of third-party funds. Our objectives are increased electrode number to 30 and 50 with almost maintained impedances and flexibility and the design and testing of actuation principles.

* **Improvement of electrode-nerv-interaction using neural cell adhesion molecules** ([Hearing4All](http://hearing4all.eu/EN/))   
Large distances between the electrode contacts of CIs and the to be stimulated spiral ganglion neurons of the cochlea as well as connective tissue growth, caused by insertion trauma and foreign body response are hypothesized to affect the quality of hearing in CI patients. The subjective of the envisaged project is to improve the electrode-nerve interaction by initiating strong adhesion of the neurons onto electrode material surfaces. At the same time a reduction of fibrous encapsulation of the electrode body is aimed. For this issue, body own cell adhesion molecules of immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig-CAMs) should be synthesized in bactria and will be used to functionalize model surfaces. The interaction of neurons onto the functionalized surfaces will be investigated using StED-microscopy to reveal any changes in neural cell adhesion with respect to surface modifications.

##Projects completed

* **Dual Energy**
A new radiographic method is developed, simulating parall measurement with two devices or different energies using only one device. Mikrostructured filters for radiographic inspection are developed. The field of application is to determine the ratio between fat tissue and muscle tissue and to distinguish foreign bodies in tissue and soft matter.   
Project Partner is [Wipotec GmbH](http://www.wipotec.com/german)

* **Fleximplants** (Lower Austra Life Science Grants)
For the recovery of senses in the face region and motorical functions in varios applications, highly flexible, multichannel and active sensors are necessary. These may allow easier surgery techniques, shorter rehabilitation and complications intervention. The reasearch group realises all-polymer electrodes for cochlear implants and demonstrates the usability in preparations or animal models. The electrodes exhibit atraumatic insertion, feasabitlity of a high number of electrode contacts and an aktive mobility and drug release. This is possible by bioinert nanofunctionalosation in 3D siloxane-hybrid systems and simulataneously developed minimally invasive insertion tools for handling very flexible miniature electrodes.   
Project partners are [ACMIT](http://www.acmit.at/) and [Otholaryngology Department](http://www.stpoelten.lknoe.at/abteilungen/hals-nasen-ohren-abteilung.html) at Universitätsklinikum St. Pölten.
