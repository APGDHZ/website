This collaboration is sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Based on the modell of the  hearing center in Hannover, the german-chilean corporation aims to provide basic research, as well as to continually improve patient care. The basis of the project is initially the scientific exchange between the project partners in hearing, medical engineering research and brain-computer interfaces (BMI) for cognitive science. The IHeaR project want to advance the international hearing research by exchanging knowledge and working together. A particular concern is to improve and accelerate research results into medical care and ultimately to patients.
