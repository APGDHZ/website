##About
The IHeaR project, developed by a team based in Prof. prof. Thomas Lenarz and Prof. Dr. med. Theodor Doll, combines the hearing research of the cluster of excellence [Hearing4All (H4A)](http://hearing4all.eu/EN/) in Hannover, with the also internationally proved group the Auditory and cognition center [Auditory and cognition center (AUCO)](http://www.auco.cl/) in Chile and Argentina. This collaboration is sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Based on the modell of the  hearing center in Hannover, the german-chilean corporation aims to provide basic research, as well as to continually improve patient care. The basis of the project is initially the scientific exchange between the project partners in hearing, medical engineering research and brain-computer interfaces (BMI) for cognitive science. The H4A and AUCO, together with IHeaR, want to advance the international hearing research by exchanging knowledge and working together and thereby improve and accelerate the reach of basic and clinical research into medical care and ultimately to patients. 

##Conferences
In order to ensure a bilateral exchange program for young researchers and doctors, three young doctors from Chile have already been received at [Hannover Medical School (MHH)](https://www.mh-hannover.de/). After the successful workshop this year, project partners are looking forward to the next meeting.

The Otorrinolaringología [(ORL 2018)](http://www.orl2018.cl/) congress will be held on **November 2018** in Santa Cruz, followed by a three-day conference with interesting workshopson **April 2019** in Buenos. Following this, in **November 2019** the kick-off of the consolidation phase will be implented to manifestate prepared political decision at ministerial level. In **2020**, doctors and hearing researchers will be invited to Santiago for the two-day dissemination meeting. Subsequently, scientists and experts from South America will be invited to Hannover for the **2020** Symposium "Workshop Medicine and Engineering in Hearing Restoration". Thereafter,  a Scientific Meeting will take place in Buenos Aires in **2021**. And finally, in **2022** the last Scientific meeting will be held in Santiago and a wrap up Meeting in Buenos Aires will complete the IHeaR project.
