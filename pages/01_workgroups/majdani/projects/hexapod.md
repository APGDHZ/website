title: Mini-Hexapod


## Mini-Hexapod

### Minimally invasive cochlear implant surgery
-  Drilling a direct access to the cochleainstead of removing parts of the lateral skull base
-  Diameter of the drill canal: ≈ 2 mm

### Challenges
-  Targeting the cochlea with an accuracy better than 0.5 mm
-  Preserving vital structures such as the facial nerve and chorda tympani

### Approach considered here
-  A bone-attached, passive, parallel kinematic device
