title: EMS

### Aims:

"Electromechanical Stimulation of the Cochlea" (EMS)

    Development of a novel implant allowing for simultaneous electrical and mechanical cochlea stimulation 

### Expected benefit of such mechanisms:

    Research has shown that in case of residual hearing, the best hearing perception can be achieved by simultaneous employment of a hearing aid and cochlear implant. Motivated by this discovery, the project aim is to develop a single implant capable of both electrical and mechanical cochlea stimulation. The main task herein is the development, layout and optimization of miniaturized mechanical actuators which can be incorporated into existing cochlear implants.
