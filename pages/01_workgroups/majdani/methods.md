-   imaging of cochlear implants after insertion

### Image processing and software development

-   visualization and processing of medical images
-   manually and semi-automated segmentation
-   trajectory planning
-   bone thickness calculation and visualization
-   visualization of cochlear anatomy using rotating midmodiolar slice planes
-   software development using C++, VTK, ITK, Matlab, Mathematica, LabView

### 3D modelling

-   anatomica models of the lateral skull base and the surgical approach
-   finite element models of the human inner ear and the electrode array
-   physicial replica of the human inner ear (artificial cochlear model)

### Medical device development and evaluation 

-   surgical assistance devices for minimally invasive cochlear implantation surgery
-   surgical tools and medical devices such as
    - image-guides surgery systems
    - medical robots
    - micro-stereotactic frames (surgical templates)
    - manual and automated insertion tools
    - drilling tools, laser hand pieces, and endoscopes

### CI electrode development

-   functionalization (shape memory inlays, fluid-mechanical actuators, tubular manipulators,...)
-   individualization (length, thickness, shape change,...)
-   virtual prototyping using finite element analysis
-   simulation and optimization of the individual insertion process

### CI electrode characterization
