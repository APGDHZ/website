Welcome to the Inner Ear Biology 2017 in Hannover! 

We take over the relay and continue the tradition of the meeting that has the longest history in auditory research. 

The first Inner Ear Biology meeting took place in Nov. 6-7, 1964. 
It was organized by Prof. S. Rauch and Prof. A. Meyer zu Gottesberge in Düsseldorf, Germany. This was 7 years before the first Society of Neuroscience meeting and 12 years before the first meeting of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology took place. 

In 2017, we want to provide a platform for an excellent scientific interchange, and want to introduce you to the city of Hannover, founded in 12 century, a city of long history but also the place of the struggle for survival after the heavy destruction during WW2. Our city's most important child, Gottfried Leibniz, has developed here many of ideas that changed the world of science - including the binary calculus. William Herschel, the astronomer, Emile Berliner, the inventor of the gramophone, and Walter Bruch, the inventor of the color TV, were all born here. Hannover has the largest city forrest, the wonderful royal gardens of Herrenhausen, close is the medieval city of Celle, a nearby abbey of Weinhausen from 12th century - a jewel and a must for the interested visitor. Hannover kings ruled also the United Kingdom for several generations. We are no longer a kingdom; the Hannover kings do not ‘rule the world’, but Hannover has become an outstanding place for science. In this tradition we are proud to may organize the Inner Ear Biology 2017.  

Details for abstract submission will follow in 2017. Hope to see you in Hannover!
