#Polymerbased microfabrication techniques for implants
Mikrokunstofffertigungstechnik für Implantate

**Content:**

This lecture provides physico-chemical basics and overview of manufacturing components for biomedical use. Essentials for the succesfull integration of implants are their  assessment and biocompatibility. Materials and manufacturing processes are introduced. Each lectures includes one  material and correlationg finilazition techniques for  specific implants and medical products.
By means of these examples, requirements for material selection and usability can be established and understood.
Tutorials include researching and exercises about biofunctionality which are discusses in class.
