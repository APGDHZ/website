## MAY 10th - 12th 2017 in Krems, Austria

### About
In the future of hearing aids and implants, which actually help deaf 
newborns as well as the aging society, Brain Computer Interfaces will once 
be needed to make a last big leap to full hearing restoration. While for 
hearing aids some activities are in midst of being started, ideas for 
implantable hearing devices remain vague. Our symposium wants to shed some 
light on possible approaches from different points of view and areas of 
research. As a follow up to the 2015 meeting held in Hannover Castle we 
reconvene in Krems, a location close to Vienna at the Danube River in the 
wonderful UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Wachau. It is overseen by castles 
and monasteries like Göttweig, where we will have one of the evening 
events. Scientifically we will catch up with recent advances in the 
specific field and discuss advantages of intracranial approaches over 
recent EEG recording techniques. Moreover, we want to foster ongoing 
activities for experts in- and outside the European Union and define 
action lines towards a specific roadmap. The symposium is held under the 
auspices of the newly inaugurated Karl-Landsteiner University and is 
co-sponsored by the state of Lower Austria.

### Aims and Execution

The accomplishment of the symposium will bring us closer in achieving two main goals:

-   define a **Roadmap**: 
    -   bring together experts, share knowledge, define critical experiments etc.

-   assemble a **Consortium** composed of research and industry for future projects: 
    -   within Germany: transregional SFB
    -   within EU: Horizon 2020 
    -   worldwide: MSCA action, EU-project with external partners

To reach these goals there will be plenary talks giving an overview into 5 main topics, expert talks giving 
us an insight into current research already leading into the direction of closing the loop. Finally, a workshop 
will give us the chance to discuss important questions initiated by the talks and of course during coffee breaks. 
We will define the most challenging questions that need to be answered to go the next step and set milestones for the 
next 10 years.  
Besides known experts in their fields we will include young researchers, industrial partners as well as delegates from 
culture and politics.
