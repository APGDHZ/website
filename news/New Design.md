We updated the design of our page, left behind typo3 and embraced new collaborative technologies like git and github.

Keep it simple; A clear separation between style and content is achieved by using the static site generator [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com) with Markdown files together with a responsive bootstrap3 custom template.

The goal to follow a grass-roots principle, so each person in our team can easily update the site via git (github or sparkleshare).

... hope you like it.
